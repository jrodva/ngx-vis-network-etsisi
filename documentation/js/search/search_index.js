creates a graph with the chosen configuration.\n\ngetNodesCount(id: string): number\nIt gets the number of nodes for a graph with a concrete id.\n\ngetNodes(id: string): DataSet | null\nIt gets the nodes for a graph with a concrete id.\n\ngetEdges(id: string): DataSet | null\nIt gets the edges for a graph with a concrete id.\n\nisAnExistingGraphNetwork(id: string): boolean\nIt returns if a graph with a concrete id exists.\n\naddNode(id: string, data: Node | Node[])\nIt adds a node in a concrete graph network.\n\nupdateNode(id: string, data: Node | Node[])\nIt updates a node in a graph network.\n\nremoveNode(id: string, nodeId: number)\nIt removes a concrete node in a graph network.\n\naddEdge(id: string, data: Edge | Edge[])\nIt adds a concrete edge in a graph network.\n\nremoveEdge(id: string, edgeId: number)\nIt removes a concrete edge in a graph network.\n\nsetBackgroundNode(id: string, nodeId: string | number, backgroundColor: string)\nIt updates a
