bug?\n\nEnsure the bug was not already reported by searching at https://github.com/jrodva/ngx-vis-network-etsisi/issues\n\nDo not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, please send an email to our support team.\n\nIf you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\nPlease, use the bug template below to create the issue.\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\n## Specifications\n- Library version:\n- Angular version:\n- Operating system:\n    - Name\n    - Version\n- Browser:\n    - Name\n    - VersionDid you write a patch that fixes a bug?\n\nFork the repository or repositories you want to work with. Add your code.\n\nOnce you think your code is ready do a Pull Request to the original ngx-vis-network-etsisi repository.\n\n\n### Where\n\n* Related PRs: Link(s) to related PR's\n* Github Issue: Github issue link\n\n### How\n\nA little description about the implementation\n\n### Screenshots\n\nIf it's necessary provide some screenshots about your PR\n\n### Test\n\nInstructions to test manually the PR \n\n### Deployment\n\nIf your changes cause changes in the deployment, please specify it\n\n### Warnings/Questions\n\nIf there are any special warnings, things to have in mind and/or critical stuff regarding those changes, please describe them here\n\nIf your changes are accepted your contribution will become part of the ngx-vis-network-etsisi repository.\n\nStyle and code formatting\n\nFor our code formatting, we use:\nTSlint,it is an extensible static analysis tool that checks code thinking in readability, maintainability, and functionality errors.\nstylelint to avoid errors and enforce conventions in the styles.\n\n\nOur syntax, conventions, and application structure is overall based on Angular Style guide.\n\nThird-party libraries\n\nThird-party libraries and components must be compatible with the ngx-vis-network-etsisi project license.\n\nDocumentation\n\nUndocumented code will be automatically rejected, a correct jsdoc is essential.\n\nRepository ownership\n\nIt's indispensable the approval of the code owner, no code will be merged into the master branch without his approval.
